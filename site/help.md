# We're getting evicted.

We're getting evicted from our apartment, apparently because of damages that my mom's ex made.

I'm disabled, because of that, I need constant care 24/7. Not having a house is dangerous to my health.

We don't have the funds to get a new apartment, so I'm calling for your help. I have a [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/octal_), which is the primary place you can donate.

Anything helps, if not monetarily, please share my message.
